# Rendering services to UQ clients

> ADS-Design standard operating procedures.

Initial question: what service do UQ Standard and UQ Standard Application Components allow us to provide to clients.

## Supplying the whole UIDF as a compiled resource

Build tool(s) to come.

## Supply specific components as a compiled resource



## Setting up a development environment for clients

At this stage, we can't yet support this.
