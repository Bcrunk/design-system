# Setup instructions
1. Install dependencies

> Firstly, you will need [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your
> system. We recommended installing the _current_ (not LTS) version for this
> project. If you use Node for other projects, you may want to use
> [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage different versions.

```shell
$ npm i
```

2. Set up package dependencies w/ Lerna

```shell
$ npx lerna bootstrap
```
