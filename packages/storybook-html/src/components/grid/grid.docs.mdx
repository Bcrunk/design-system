# Grid

Layouts using our grid are achieved using a combination of `.uq-grid` and
`.uq-grid__col` elements and their modifiers.

## Golden

This grid gives you a *main* content column and a *sidebar* column that stack
for mobile. "Under the hood", is our 6-8-12 grid so you can keep your content
consistently aligned with the base grid.

<Story height="160" id="layout-grid--golden" />

### How to

Add two `.uq-grid__col` elements within a grid container (with the
`.uq-grid--golden` modifier) like the following.

```html
<div class="uq-grid uq-grid--golden">
  <div class="uq-grid__col">Main content</div>
  <div class="uq-grid__col">Aside</div>
</div>
```

See what happens when you add more columns to the same container!

## Flexible grid

The flexible grid leverages the power of [*CSS Grid Layout*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout)
to give you a quick & flexible layout solution. You can use this grid to
organise your content into columns that stack when browser sizes are smaller.
Therefore, it makes it an ideal solution for arranging linear material. Rows
also get the same gutter (gap) as columns to make things super easy.

### How to

As an example, you can achieve three columns of content by adding three
`.uq-grid__col` elements to the grid container (with the `.uq-grid--flexible`
modifier) like the following.

```html
<div class="uq-grid uq-grid--flexible">
  <div class="uq-grid__col">1st item</div>
  <div class="uq-grid__col">2nd item</div>
  <div class="uq-grid__col">3rd item</div>
</div>
```

<Story height={85} id="layout-grid--flexible-2" />

Pay attention to what the grid does when the screens get very small.

## 6-8-12 grid

We've built a grid that adapts the number of available columns to different
screen sizes. It's a 6-, 8-, and 12-column grid built into one CSS class system!
Starting from _mobile_, the _column-span_ classes give you the freedom to craft
layouts to suit different screen sizes.

> By default, we add the [specified margins](?path=/docs/layout-layout--base-layout-grid-visualised#specifications-per-breakpoint)
> to both sides of the column row *and* apply a max-width on XL screens on the
> root `.uq-grid` node.

### Basic usage

```html
<div class="uq-grid">
  <div class="uq-grid__col uq-grid__col--4 uq-grid__col--md-5 uq-grid__col--xl-8">Content</div>
  <div class="uq-grid__col uq-grid__col--2 uq-grid__col--md-3 uq-grid__col--xl-4">Content</div>
</div>
```

<Story height={200} id="layout-grid--twelve-eight-six-example-1" />

### Stacking columns for smaller screens

To prevent your columns from getting too small, you can stack columns by
"overflowing" the row. For example, see what we're doing here with the smallest
layout with the grid:

```html
<div class="uq-grid">
  <div class="uq-grid__col uq-grid__col--6 uq-grid__col--md-5 uq-grid__col--xl-8">Content</div>
  <div class="uq-grid__col uq-grid__col--6 uq-grid__col--md-3 uq-grid__col--xl-4">Content</div>
</div>
```

The difference between this example and the one before is that the two columns
take up the whole available width for the smallest screens.

<Story height={200} id="layout-grid--twelve-eight-six-example-2" />

### The 6-column grid column-span classes (designed for _mobile_ displays)

Create layouts for the smallest screens.

`uq-grid__col--[1—6]`, e.g. `<div class="uq-grid__col uq-grid__col--4">...</div>`

<Story height={250} id="layout-grid--twelve-eight-six-mobile" />

### The 8-column grid column-span classes (designed for _tablet_ displays)

Shift the layout for larger screens.

`uq-grid__col--md-[1—8]`, e.g. `<div class="uq-grid__col uq-grid__col--4 uq-grid__col--md-6">...</div>` 

<Story height={290} id="layout-grid--twelve-eight-six-tablet" />

### The 12-column grid column-span classes (designed for _desktop/laptop_ displays)

Shift the layout for the largest screens.

`uq-grid__col--xl-[1—12]`, e.g. `<div class="uq-grid__col uq-grid__col--4 uq-grid__col--md-6 uq-grid__col--xl-8">...</div>`

<Story height={420} id="layout-grid--twelve-eight-six-desktop" />

## Nesting

> Nested `.uq-grid` elements don't have any margins or max. width applied.

<Story height={125} id="layout-grid--twelve-eight-six-nested" />

## Full-width layouts

If you want to manage the margins yourself i.e. nest the grid in your own custom
container, you can apply the `uq-grid--full-width` modifier class.

#### Example: 6-8-12 grid

```html
<div class="uq-grid uq-grid--full-width">
  <div class="uq-grid__col uq-grid__col--7">Your content</div>
  <div class="uq-grid__col uq-grid__col--5">Your content</div>
</div>
```

<Story height={85} id="layout-grid--twelve-eight-six-full-width" />

#### Example: flexible grid

```html
<div class="uq-grid uq-grid--flexible uq-grid--full-width">
  <div class="uq-grid__col">Content</div>
  <div class="uq-grid__col">Content</div>
  <div class="uq-grid__col">Content</div>
</div>
```

<Story height={85} id="layout-grid--flexible-full-width" />
