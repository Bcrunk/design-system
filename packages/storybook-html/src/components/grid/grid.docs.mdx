# Grid
<StatusBadge.Stable />

Layouts using our grid are achieved using a combination of `.uq-grid` (grid
container) and `.uq-grid__col` (grid column) elements and their modifiers.

## Golden

This grid gives you a *main* content column and a *sidebar* column that stack
for mobile. Under the hood, is our *6-8-12* grid so you can keep your content
consistently aligned with the base grid.

<Story height="160" id="layout-grid--golden" />

### How-to

Add two `.uq-grid__col` elements within a grid container (with the
`.uq-grid--golden` modifier) like the following.

```html
<div class="uq-grid uq-grid--golden">
  <div class="uq-grid__col">Main content</div>
  <div class="uq-grid__col">Aside</div>
</div>
```

See what happens when you add more columns to the same container!

> All of our grids' rows get the same gutter (gap) as columns by default. So,
> when columns stack, your contents are conveniently spaced out.

## Halves

Behaves like *Golden* but has two columns of equal size at larger screen sizes.

<Story height={85} id="layout-grid--halves" />

### How-to

```html
<div class="uq-grid uq-grid--halves">
  <div class="uq-grid__col">Content</div>
  <div class="uq-grid__col">Content</div>
</div>
```

## Thirds

Behaves like *Golden* but has three columns of equal size at larger screen
sizes.

<Story height={85} id="layout-grid--thirds" />

### How-to

```html
<div class="uq-grid uq-grid--thirds">
  <div class="uq-grid__col">Content</div>
  <div class="uq-grid__col">Content</div>
  <div class="uq-grid__col">Content</div>
</div>
```

## Quarters

Behaves like *Golden* but has four columns of equal size at larger screen sizes.

<Story height={85} id="layout-grid--quarters" />

### How-to

```html
<div class="uq-grid uq-grid--quarters">
  <div class="uq-grid__col">Content</div>
  <div class="uq-grid__col">Content</div>
  <div class="uq-grid__col">Content</div>
  <div class="uq-grid__col">Content</div>
</div>
```

## Flexible grid

The flexible grid leverages the power of [*CSS Grid Layout*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout)
to give you a quick & flexible layout solution. You can use this grid to
organise your content into columns that stack when browser sizes are smaller.
Therefore, it makes it an ideal solution for arranging linear material.

<Story height={175} id="layout-grid--flexible-1" />

### How-to

As an example, you can achieve three columns of content by adding three
`.uq-grid__col` elements to the grid container (with the `.uq-grid--flexible`
modifier) like the following.

```html
<div class="uq-grid uq-grid--flexible">
  <div class="uq-grid__col">1st item</div>
  <div class="uq-grid__col">2nd item</div>
  <div class="uq-grid__col">3rd item</div>
</div>
```

<Story height={85} id="layout-grid--flexible-2" />

Pay attention to what the grid does when the screens get very small.

## 6-8-12 grid

If you're looking for more control over your layout, we've built a grid that
adapts the number of available columns to different screen sizes. It's a 6-, 8-,
and 12-column grid built into one CSS class system! Starting from _mobile_, the
_column-span_ classes give you the freedom to craft layouts to suit different
screen sizes.

> By default, we add the [specified margins](?path=/docs/layout-layout--base-layout-grid-visualised#specifications-per-breakpoint)
> to both sides of the column row *and* apply a max-width on XL screens on the
> root `.uq-grid` node.

### Basic how-to

```html
<div class="uq-grid">
  <div class="uq-grid__col uq-grid__col--4 uq-grid__col--md-5 uq-grid__col--xl-8">Content</div>
  <div class="uq-grid__col uq-grid__col--2 uq-grid__col--md-3 uq-grid__col--xl-4">Content</div>
</div>
```

<Story height={200} id="layout-grid--twelve-eight-six-example-1" />

### Stacking columns for smaller screens

To prevent your columns from getting too small, you can stack columns by
"overflowing" the row. For example, see what we're doing here with the smallest
layout with the grid:

```html
<div class="uq-grid">
  <div class="uq-grid__col uq-grid__col--6 uq-grid__col--md-5 uq-grid__col--xl-8">Content</div>
  <div class="uq-grid__col uq-grid__col--6 uq-grid__col--md-3 uq-grid__col--xl-4">Content</div>
</div>
```

The difference between this example and the one before is that the two columns
take up the whole available width for the smallest screens.

<Story height={200} id="layout-grid--twelve-eight-six-example-2" />

### The 6-column grid column-span classes (designed for _mobile_ displays)

Create layouts for the smallest screens.

`uq-grid__col--[1—6]`, e.g. `<div class="uq-grid__col uq-grid__col--4">...</div>`

<Story height={265} id="layout-grid--twelve-eight-six-mobile" />

### The 8-column grid column-span classes (designed for _tablet_ displays)

Shift the layout for larger screens.

`uq-grid__col--md-[1—8]`, e.g. `<div class="uq-grid__col uq-grid__col--4 uq-grid__col--md-6">...</div>` 

<Story height={305} id="layout-grid--twelve-eight-six-tablet" />

### The 12-column grid column-span classes (designed for _desktop/laptop_ displays)

Shift the layout for the largest screens.

`uq-grid__col--xl-[1—12]`, e.g. `<div class="uq-grid__col uq-grid__col--4 uq-grid__col--md-6 uq-grid__col--xl-8">...</div>`

<Story height={430} id="layout-grid--twelve-eight-six-desktop" />

## Nesting

> Nested `.uq-grid` elements don't have any margins or max. width applied.

<Story height={125} id="layout-grid--twelve-eight-six-nested" />

## Full-width layouts

If you want to manage the margins yourself i.e. nest the grid in your own custom
container, you can apply the `uq-grid--full-width` modifier class.

#### Example: 6-8-12 grid

```html
<div class="uq-grid uq-grid--full-width">
  <div class="uq-grid__col uq-grid__col--7">Your content</div>
  <div class="uq-grid__col uq-grid__col--5">Your content</div>
</div>
```

<Story height={85} id="layout-grid--twelve-eight-six-full-width" />

#### Example: flexible grid

```html
<div class="uq-grid uq-grid--flexible uq-grid--full-width">
  <div class="uq-grid__col">Content</div>
  <div class="uq-grid__col">Content</div>
  <div class="uq-grid__col">Content</div>
  <div class="uq-grid__col">Content</div>
  <div class="uq-grid__col">Content</div>
</div>
```

<Story height={120} id="layout-grid--flexible-full-width" />

## Alternative layout container

The `.uq-layout-container` class is used as an alternative to the `.uq-grid` class. its display is set to `block` instead of `grid` or `flex`. 
It uses @mixins `layout-containment` and `grid-col-padding` to set its margin and paddings respectively. It is used as a complimentary class to layout contents.

```html
  <div class="uq-layout-container">
    Hello world!
  </div>
```

<Story height={85} id="layout-grid--layout-container" />


## Mixins

The `@uqds/grid` package provides [*mixins*](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/mixin)
to help you develop your own CSS rules using Sass such that they align with our
layout system.

### `layout-containment`

Modifies the `margin-[left, right]` and `max-width` properties of your element
to contain the contents within in the design system fashion.

<Story id="layout-grid--layout-containment" />

```html
<!-- custom.html -->

<!-- ... -->

<div class="my-custom-container">
  Hello word!
</div>

<!-- ... -->
```

```scss
/* custom.scss */

// First, import and declare namespace for the grid mixins file 
@use '@uqds/grid/src/scss/global' as grid;

.my-custom-container {
  // Then, use the mixin like so:
  @include grid.layout-containment;
  
  // ...
}

// ...
```
