# Body

## Install as a dependency

```bash
npm i @uq-uidf/body
```

```bash
yarn add @uq-uidf/body
```

## Basic usage with Sass

```scss
// With a namespace (recommended)
@use '@uq-uidf/body/src/scss/_component' as body;

// Without a namespace
@use '@uq-uidf/body/src/scss/_component' as *;
```

## ⚠️ Encapsulating the styles (in Sass) for established projects

This stylesheet can affect HTML elements globally and provides non-prefixed
utility CSS classes. If you are modifying an existing project with base styles
already in place, we recommended importing the stylesheet with encapsulation
enabled (to avoid selector clashes).

```scss
@use '@uq-uidf/body/src/scss/_component' as body with (
  $use-encapsulation: true
);
```

You can now wrap any amount of HTML content with the `uq` class to apply the
package stylesheet to a subset of elements. For example:

```html
  ...
  <div class="uq">
    <h2>I will be styled with <span class="text--weight-medium">this</span> stylesheet.</h2>
    <p>As will I.</p>
  </div>
  ...
```

You can also apply the `uq` class to the `<body>` tag (if your objective is to
add more [specificity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity)
to the package styles) to apply the stylesheet globally. Otherwise, by default,
this stylesheet will effect the `body` tag and its descendants globally anyway.

```html
<body class="uq">
  ...
```
