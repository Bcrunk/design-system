# Layout

Our responsive layout system gives you the tools to organise content and UI
components in a variety of ways. It also adapts to different screen sizes and
orientation. The primary elements of our layout system are *columns*, *margins*,
and *gutters* (the ingredients of a *horizontal* grid system). Our unit of
measurement is the [*rem*](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_units.asp).

## Getting started

To fulfil your design requirements, we have several options in our layout system
for you to choose from.

| Name         | Description | Thumbnail |
| ------------ | ----------- | ------------------ |
| Golden | [TODO] Inspired by [*The Golden Ratio*](https://www.canva.com/learn/what-is-the-golden-ratio/). Compose simple layouts that are pleasing to the eye. | Coming soon |
| Flexible grid | [TODO] Auto-sizing grid. | Coming soon |
| Halves | [TODO] A two-column grid. | Coming soon |
| Thirds | [TODO] A three-column grid. | Coming soon |
| Quarters | [TODO] A four-column grid. | Coming soon |
| Scrolling grid | [TODO] A grid that scrolls horizontally on mobile. Useful for holding cards. | Coming soon |
| [6-8-12](/?path=/docs/layout-grid--twelve-eight-six) | Advanced. The most consistent, flexible implementation of our layout system. It is what our other layouts are built upon. | Coming soon |

> Currently, all our layout options can be used by installing or downloading the
> [`@uq-uidf/grid`](?path=/docs/layout-grid--basic-usage) package into your
> project.

Our layout system is built upon a 6-8-12 column strategy — our base grid.

## Designing with the base grid (for UI mockups)

We should prepare mockups for our three major breakpoints: mobile, tablet, and
desktop/laptop. We recommend creating **375px width artboard mockups for the
mobile range. For the others, we take the starting value of the range** as our
artboard width. In some UI design programs (e.g. Figma, Adobe XD), you can
define a layout grid using the column, margin, and gutter (px) values we've
supplied. You can also use the following sizing/spacing references.

### Desktop

## Glossary

### Columns

Columns are the areas of space where content can be displayed. Column width is
calculated based on percentages and gutter width.

### Gutters

A gutter is the spacing between columns. They are fixed-width but the value
changes to adapt to different screen sizes.

### Margins

Margins are the space on either side of the entire row of columns. They are
specified using a minimum width because they change to adapt to different screen
sizes. I.e. we use wider margins for larger screens. Therefore, to ensure that
larger screens always have a wider set of columns than smaller screens, we
perform an easing technique from one margin ideal to the next ideal. Think of it
as counter-balancing the big jumps in margin width.
