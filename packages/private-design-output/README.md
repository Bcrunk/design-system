> Generate a flat distribution of the UIDF

## Modify to achieve desired output

Modify the `src/js/main.js` and `src/scss/main.scss` files to customise your
output. Please consider that other users of this package may require resources
that you do not â€” so be careful when deleting contents if you intend to commit
changes.

## Run tasks

Firstly, make sure you are in the correct working directory i.e.,

```bash
cd [path to repo...]/user-interface-development-framework/packages/private-design-output
```

From this directory, run:

```bash
gulp
```

## The kitchen sink

The intention is that the `dist/kitchen-sink.html` file gets better with time.
Please contribute any additional examples you might require to the file if they
do not yet exist.
